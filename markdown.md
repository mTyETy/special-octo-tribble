> President Biden, during a rare Oval Office interview, told the New Yorker's Evan Osnos that he doesn't think former President Trump will concede if he loses in November.

    "Losers who are losers are never graceful," Biden says in the 14,000-word profile, "The Last Campaign," which the magazine posted Monday morning. "I just think that he'll do anything to try to win. If — and when — I win, I think he'll contest it. No matter what the result is."

    > An important application of the Schur decomposition is to compute matrix functions. The relation f(A) = Qf(T)Q^* shows that computing f(A) reduces to computing a function of a triangular matrix. Matrix functions illustrate what Van Loan (1975) describes as “one of the most basic tenets of numerical algebra”, namely “anything that the Jordan decomposition can do, the Schur decomposition can do better!”. Indeed the Jordan canonical form is built on a possibly ill conditioned similarity transformation while the Schur decomposition employs a perfectly conditioned unitary similarity, and the full upper triangular factor of the Schur form can do most of what the Jordan form’s bidiagonal factor can do.
